# Text-NonText-Separation
In Brief:
This is a Research Project(ML Based) under supervision of Associate Prof Ram Sarkar(Jadavpur University)
Here we have proposed a novel text/non-text separation method in printed documents.In our Algorithm 
we have used Rotation invariant of Texture Based Local Ternary pattern and to eliminate the redundant features 
we have used Binary Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm .

Classification Accuracy:
Greater than 95%,given in the attached research paper

Language used:
Matlab

Time span:
sept-19 - Jan-20
